# Creating the Standard Library in C from Scratch

This project was done at a free coding school called '42 Silicon Valley', which was unfortunately shut down permanently after the 2020 pandemic. It originally started in france, this is the [french '42' school's website](https://42.fr/en/homepage/). The US 42 schools website was shutdown but their [old instagram](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) is still up if you are curious what the school was about.

## Instructions 

'42' had no in-person instructors, it was a self taught school. For instructions, they [gave us this PDF](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Std_C_Library_42SiliconValley/blob/main/Libft.pdf) and an iMac and let us go to work. The only requirement being that we were in the 'computer lab' 40 hrs / week.
