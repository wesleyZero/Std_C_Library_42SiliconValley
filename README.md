# Creating the Standard Library in C from Scratch

This project was done at a free coding school called '42 Silicon Valley', which was unfortunately shut down permanently after the 2020 pandemic.

## Instructions I was given

'42' had no in-person instructors, it was a self taught school. For instructions, they [gave us this PDF](https://github.com/wesleyZero/Std_C_Library_42SiliconValley/blob/main/Libft.pdf)
